hi!

this engine was made because I wanted to learn coding. yup.

you may know a lil thing called Psych Engine. Yeah that is way better, but there are many cool things in here too!
You need to recompile the code to make mods. It's not that advanced yet, but modcharts are a thing! (a way to change code without recompiling the game)

I also already ported many old and new songs from various mods!

love to the funkin' crew and newgrounds â™¥
